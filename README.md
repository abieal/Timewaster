PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is a web app designed to help users waste their time in the most entertaining way possible! Itâ€™s a 100-level game where each level offers a ridiculous and silly task,
ranging from simple button clicks to bizarre typing challenges. Each level unlocks sequentially, giving users fake achievements and tracking their progress as they move forward. 
The app uses localStorage to save progress and increase the total time wasted.

THE PROBLEM

People often need more ways to waste time productively... or not! In a world full of productive apps,
we saw an opportunity to create something that adds zero value to your life but gives maximum enjoyment. 
Our app is designed to waste your time in the most glorious way possible.

THE SOLUTION

Introducing 100 Levels of Glorious Time Waste! A web app that takes you on an epic journey of unnecessary tasks.
Complete each task to unlock the next level and earn fake achievements. Track your wasted time and life progress with fun stats!
